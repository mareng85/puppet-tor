## Overview
This module sets up Tor anonymous proxy as a client, relay or exit node.

## Module Description
This module sets up Tor anonymous proxy as a client, relay or exit node. 
Then you can do the web almost anonymously. 

## Setup

### What tor affects

* Will create the config file /etc/tor/torrc used by Tor
* If using TorÂ´sown DNS service, make sure you forward the traffic going to port 53 to port 5353 (or whatever port you set for Tor DNS)

### Beginning with tor

Set your browser proxy settings to listen on 127.0.0.1:9050 using SOCKS5.

## Usage

For using as client:

    class{'::tor::client':}

Same as above, but setting some custom values:

    class{'::tor::client':
      socks_port           => ['127.0.0.1:9000',],
      socks_policy         => [ 'accept *:80', ],
      deamon               => true,
    }

For using as client with Tor DNS and with Control Port:

    class{'::tor::client':
       $ensure          => running,
       $dns_port        => '5353',
       $control_port    => '9051',
    }


For using as relay:

    class{'::tor::relay':}

For using as exit node:
    
    class{'::tor::exitnode':}

## Limitations

This module is tested, as far, only on CentOS 7 running Puppet 4 but should be compatible wihh earlier version of Puppet as well.
